# Simple Image Annotation Tool

## How to run
* The main.ts file is already compiled as a main.js file, so all you need to do is run the index.html file.


## Information about the program
* There are sample images in the /images/ folder.  The selected image can be changed in main.ts as the `img` variable.
* The JSON OUTPUT button writes the output as a JSON string.  This string can be accessed through the variable `outputInJSON`.
* The outputs can be viewed in the console.
* Point and annotation ID's are labelled by the number of points and annotations.
